# Online Chess Platform

This repository contains the source code for an online chess platform developed as a school project. The platform offers an interactive chess-playing experience directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chessboard dynamically adjusts its size based on the browser window’s dimensions, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **FEN Support**: Users can input Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) strings to load specific board positions. The platform validates FEN inputs and updates the board accordingly.
- **Dark Mode Compatibility**: The interface adapts to the user’s system settings, supporting both light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.
- **Piece Interaction**: Players can move pieces using drag-and-drop functionality or by clicking, providing a flexible user experience.
- **Board Orientation**: Includes an option to flip the board, allowing players to view the game from either player’s perspective.
